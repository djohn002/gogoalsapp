# gogoalsapp

This is my first Go app created using a local MySQL DB, Go for the server, and CSS/Bootstrap for the front end.  I created this app without following any tutorials & pieced together what I can find from documentation, various sources on the Internet, stack overflow, help of mentors, etc. I also started unit testing in the test file. Feedback would be appreciated on how I can improve my code!

Entry point for the app is goals.go
The server & router are found in the server.go (server package)
